## Playground Templates
Playground templates is the official repository of the @ nicht / playgrounds project. Here, you can find several templates for the most varied programming languages. Take a look at what we have to offer!

## Currently Supported Languagues
We currently have the following languages available with some templates.

    * NodeJS

## Adding new templates
If you want to add a template that is not here, it is very easy! Fork the project in your github and then create the template you think is necessary within the correct folder of your language, for example:

    .
    ├── node
    ├──── api-express
    ├──── react-client
    ├──── lerna-monorepo
    ├──── your_awesome_template_goes_here
    
## Wonderful! How do I download a template?
For this, it is recommended to use [@nicht/playground](https://github.com/nicht/playground) for this. This is a tool developed to be able to manage the templates provided here. Note: it is still in the alpha stage of development.
